# Node MongoDB Connect Starter 

## Description
This is a starter project for connecting Node.js applications with MongoDB. It provides a basic template with all the necessary dependencies and configuration files to quickly set up a connection and interact with a MongoDB database.

## Features
1.  [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a free and open
-source cross-platform document database that stores JSON-like documents with schema.

2.
This starter kit provides the basic structure for building an application using:
    -   ExpressJS as
    web framework; 
    -   Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to work with
    MongoDB databases, which allows you
        to create models of your data in JavaScript code without having any knowledge
        about how Mongo works internally; 
        -   Passport authentication middleware package to handle user registration/login
